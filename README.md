# Project: HTML/CSS | The Odin Project

Mini project to deconstruct Google.com webpage and reconstruct using HTML and CSS. Basic layout and box model practice - links and buttons don't go anywhere. Good practice for getting used to basic Git workflow. Struggled a bit with general layout and especially with figuring out which styles would take precedence. Formatting is still a bit rough, but for my first build in HTML and CSS, I'm pretty happy with how things turned out.
